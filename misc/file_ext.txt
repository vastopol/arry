file extensions:

* Matlab files use ".m" 

* J script files use ".ijs"

	however I can't get working properly yet

	APL source is traditionally stored in system dependent workspaces
	this appears to be slightly more complicated when using text files.
	since APL code uses symbols not in ASCII need to have Unicode.
	
	should be possible with builtin Dyalog functions for this ??
	functions look like "]name args" or "⎕name args" or ")name args"
	
	Dyalog.NET compiled ASP.NET source files
	
	SALT (Simple APL Library Toolkit) introduced in version 12.x
	]load filename
	⎕SE.SALT.Load 'filename'
	
	Version 15.0 added support to the interpreter
	Editing directly from Windows Explorer
	⎕FIX 'file://filename.dyalog'
	)ed file://filename.dyalog 
	
	]load
	
	]save	
	
	]link ns dir
	"links" a namespace structure to a folder structure.
	Each function, operator, class or scripted namespace corresponds to an external file
